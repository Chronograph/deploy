From the main dashboard, you make click the `Add project` button.

## Deploy on push

Deploy-on-push allows for automatic deployments during every push to your repository.

This can be enabled by going to your project's settings page.

## Update project

The following can be updated from your project's settings page:

* Project name
* Provider host
* Provider repository
* Repository branch

## Delete project

Note: Once a project is deleted, it cannot be undone.

You may delete your project by clicking `Delete project`, which will then display a prompt to confirm.
